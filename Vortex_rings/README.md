The dataset and codes for the manuscript:

"Experimental observation of vortex rings in a bulk magnet"

Nature Physics (2020)

Contains:

- Reconstruction of the magnetisation for the three magnetic configurations presented in the paper, in both .mat and .vtk format, for analysis and visualisation with matlab and paraview.

- Analysis codes for the calculation of the magnetic vorticity from the magnetisation

- Paraview state files for the visualisation and analysis of the configurations.
