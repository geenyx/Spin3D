A gradient-based optimisation routine for the reconstruction of three-dimensional magnetisation structures from a set of single polarisation X-ray projections with XMCD contrast.

The codes are written in matlab, and there is an example simulated micromagnetic structure provided with which one can become familiar with the code.

Licence inforrmation is provided, and a readme file offers instructions for use.
