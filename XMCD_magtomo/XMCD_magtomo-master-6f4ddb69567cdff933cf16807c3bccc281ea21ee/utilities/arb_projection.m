%
% Computes a projection along Z after an arbitrary rotation of the object
% tomo_obj_all defined by the rotation matrix R.
%
%  Inputs
%  tomo_obj_all   - A 3D or 4D array to allow for tensor tomography, first
%                   three indices are spatial coordinates and the fourth allows for instance
%                   for another quantity that varies along the fourth index, e.g. detector
%                   angular section.
%  X, Y, Z        - 3D arrays that define the array dimension that
%                   corresponds to X Y Z respectively. They must be integer
%                   valued and they must have unit interval between voxels.
%                   May be created with meshgrid. These arrays allow you to
%                   define which array dimension corresponds to X, Y, Z
%                   respectively. The rotation is around X = Y = Z = 0.
%                   Even if this point does not exist in the array.
% R               - 3x3 rotation matrix that describes the rotation of the
%                   object in vector convention. [x;y;z] = R*[x;y;z]
% p               - Structure that defines the parameters of the projection
% p.volume_upsampling = 1 - the volume is upsampled by a factor 2 before
%                   the projection. Algorithm takes about 8 times longer
%                   but reduces artifacts significantly without sacrificing
%                   too much accuracy. Default = 0.
% p.filter_2D       Filter strength on the resulting 2D projection to reduce
%                   artifacts but also resolution. ( = 0) No filter.
%                   Maximum filtering for ( = 3) default. Note that if you
%                   use p.volume_upsampling = 1 the filter is applied on an
%                   upsampled 2D projection, so the decrease of resolution
%                   by the filter will be much less.
% p.method          'nearest' or 'bilinear', the method affects the
%                   allocation of the voxel values into the 2D array.
% xout, yout        Row arrays, e.g. [-10:10] that specify the output
%                   coordinates of the projection. Values should be spaced
%                   by one but a subpixel shift can be added, could be useful
%                   for including projection misalignment. By default
%                   the vectors corresponds to the range of X and Y.
%
% Manuel Guizar - 2014.06.05
%
% If not using recommended settings significant artifacts have been observed
% for rotations by 23, 28, 37, 45 or 53 degrees. I recommend to look once
% at a projection of a sphere from the angles of your experiment to
% determine how strong the artifacts would be. Code to generate a smooth
% sphere is included as comments at the end of the function.
%
% Recommended settings:
%%%% Fast & low artifacts & low resolution %%%
%   p.volume_upsampling = 0;
%   p.filter_2D = 3;           % Lower values give you compromise between resolution and artifacts
%   p.method = 'bilinear';     % 'nearest' or 'bilinear'
%
%%%% Slow & low artifacts & high resolution %%%
%   Still gives some artifacts at 45 degrees if only rotated around z
%   p.volume_upsampling = 1;
%   p.filter_2D = 3;           % Lower values give you compromise between resolution and artifacts
%   p.method = 'bilinear';     % 'nearest' or 'bilinear'
